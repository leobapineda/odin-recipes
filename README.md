# odin-recipes
Ok, sooo the current roject is to create a basic recipe website, I think I have to put at least 3 dishes that i like, or I can use some examples from a webpage that the odin project team gives us. 
By the end of the lesson I would have demostrated the knowledge I have adquired through out the curse, so hopelly it'll be something not to bad. 
Wish me luck. 
Leo.
